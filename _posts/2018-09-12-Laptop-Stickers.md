CompSoc is back in business with a bang, baby!! We've been through a rough patch these last few years so what better way to kick off our comeback year with free stuff (everybody loves free stuff, right?)
We've got brand new stickers for you to pimp your laptop with and don't worry, there's more than plenty to go around!
So come round to our freshers' stall on Wednesday the 26th to pick up your free laptop sticker!

Don't miss out!
Your social sec Aitor
