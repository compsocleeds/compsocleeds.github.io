There is a CompSoc EGM, all members should attend:

Our social secretary has unfortunately stood down, meaning we need to find his replacement.

Apart from that, come and voice your opinion on how CompSoc should be run, and how it can serve you better. If you want an item added to the agenda, or to nominate yourself/anyone else for social secretary, please email: sc17b3c@leeds.ac.uk
