The CompSoc Leeds is back in business!

You can meet us at Leeds Freshers fair on Wednesday 26th September from 10-11 AM (quiet hour) and 11 AM - 4 PM at the main fair location.

If you cannot come but still want to join, please use one of the links available in the description or contact us on the official page.

Get ready to boot things up with a bang! So when your CPU gets over-worked, come and blow off some steam and get involved with gaming, nights out, bowling and much, much more!

So far this semester, we've got a whole host of activities planned including LAN parties, Hackathons, Tech Talks, Coding Challenges and some big nights out as part of the Faculty of Engineering so bring your friends and come and get involved!
